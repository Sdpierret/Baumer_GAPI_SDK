##           3     HOW TO INSTALL EXAMPLES


                 IF YOU INSTALLED THE CONTENT OF THE BGAPI-CD TO ANY FOLDER
                 <<<BUT>>> "PROGRAM FILES" JUST RUN 

                 ***install_example_win.bat***

                 BY DOUBLE-CLICK OR HITTING ENTER AND FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS
                 BELOW.

                 IF YOU INSTALLED THE CONTENT OF THE BGAPI-CD TO THE FOLDER
                 "PROGRAM FILES" OR ANY OTHER FOLDER WHICH NEEDS AN ADMINISTRA-
                 TOR USER ACCOUNT PLEASE START A NEW COMMAND PROMPT (e.g. VISUAL
                 STUDIO COMMAND PROMPT) AND CHANGE THE PATH TO THE DIRECTORY 
                 WHERE THE BATCH FILE IS LOCATED ("cd .."). THEN CALL
                 
                 install_example_win.bat
                 
                 THE BATCH-FILE WILL GUIDE YOU THROUGH THE INSTALLATION PROCESS.
                 ON WRONG USER-INPUT BY DEFAULT VISUAL STUDIO 2010 Win32 IS SET.
                 
                 AS THE INSTALLATION IS FINISHED YOU SHOULD FIND A NEW FOLDER
                 CONTAINING A SOLUTION AND OTHER FILES ACCORDING TO YOUR CHOICE
                 WHICH IDE AND PLATFORM TO USE.
                 
                 IF NOT, POSSIBLY SOMETHING WENT WRONG. CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING
                 ISSUES:

                   * YOU DO NOT HAVE CMAKE INSTALLED.
                     => INSTALL CMAKE AND TRY AGAIN.

                   * YOU HAVE CMAKE INSTALLED, BUT IT WAS NOT IDENTIFIED.
                     => OPEN A COMMAND WINDOW AND CHECK IF YOU FIND CMAKE IN PATH
                        IF CMAKE IS INCLUDED IN PATH, RUN THE BATCH-FILE FROM 
                        THIS COMMAND WINDOW.
                        IF CMAKE IS NOT INCLUDED IN PATH REBOOT AND RUN THE
                        BATCH-FILE AGAIN.
                   * OR -
                     => EDIT YOUR LOCAL "PATH" AND MAKE SURE IT CONTAINS
                        THE PATH TO YOUR CMAKE BINARIES. IF YOU CHANGE THE SYSTEM
                        ENVIROMENT YOU NEED TO REBOOT AFTERWARDS.
                   * OR -
                     => OPEN THE BATCH FILE FOR EDITING. UNCOMMENT LINE 13
                        ("SET N_CMAKE=0") AND TRY AGAIN. 
                        
                   * INSTALLATION FAILED DUE TO MISSING USER RIGHTS.
                     => CHANGE YOUR USER ACCOUNT TO ADMIN AND TRY AGAIN.
                     
                   * UNKNOWN COMPILER / UNKNOWN IDE / UNKNOWN PLATFORM
                     => PLEASE READ $ 3 LIMITATIONS
             

##           4     HOW TO RUN EXAMPLES


                 IF INSTALLED SUCCESSFULLY OPEN THE NEW CREATED FOLDER E.G.

                 "build_vs10_c"

                 OPEN THE CREATED SOLUTION

                 "Baumer_GAPI_SDK_Examples_C.sln"

                 ONCE OPENED JUST CHOOSE A STARTUP-PROJECT AND HIT F5.


##           5     LIMITATIONS


                 THE INSTALLATION AND EXECUTION OF THESE EXAMPLES WAS TESTED
                 TO WORK WITH ALL IDEs AND PLATFORMs NAMED IN THE USER MENU OF 
                 THE install_example_win.bat. HOWEVER IF YOU ARE A EXPERIENCED 
                 USER OF CMAKE YOU ARE FREE TO CREATE ANY CONFIGURATION YOU WANT.
                 IN THIS CASE DO NOT USE THE BATCH-FILE BUT CALL CMAKE WITHIN
                 THE DIRECTORY WHERE THE BATCH FILE IS LOCATED.

                 FOR FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS TYPE "CMAKE --HELP" INSIDE A COMMAND
                 PROMPT.
